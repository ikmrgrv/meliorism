# About Kumar Gaurav

## Okay Kumar, so tell me about yourself...

Sure. To start with, you can call me Kumar or Gaurav, both works! (Some people go with full name, or initialst too...)  
*I am a little too busy in my life to mind any of that...*

Born and brought up in parts of Central India, shifted to Delhi before joining [college in Bangalore](https://www.msrit.edu/).  
Graduated in 2018, I started working with startups and enjoyed it sooo much, that I am based out of [HSR Layout](/hsr-layout) now and enjoy the vast community of founders and investors here. Made a few really good friends here.

I interned and worked full time briefly as business development executive with a Flipkart funded startup, moving quickly to the software realm. Worked for 5ish years as FullStack Software Engineer with startups of various size and scale ( [details below](/about-kumar-gaurav.html#software-engineer) ). Enjoyed working close to founders.

To harness my new found interest in Entrepreneurship, I left Quizizz in Jan'23 and started building my own company. Lots of learnings, realised what I am good at (*tech, product, analytics*) and what I need to work upon (*cold-communications, sales, marketing, strategies, market-research*).

Looking to start working full-time again. In search of a good team and company to build amazing products.
I would love to hear from you if you think there's a great opportunity for us to work together.
