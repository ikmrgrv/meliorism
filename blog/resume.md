## Technical Entrepreneurship (Jan 2023 - present)
Harnessing my interest in Entrepreneurship, I started building my own company full time since January 2023

### Twople
- Twople was a marketplace of activites, events and expereiences for working busy couples who find it exhausting to go through never-ending list of suggestions on social medias and search platforms to find one simple thing to do
<!-- - Business metrics before shutting down operations - -->
- 
  | Business Metrics            |  #    |
  |-----------------------------|------:|
  | Monthly Active Users (MAU)  | 500   |
  | Monthly Orders Placed       | ~40   |
  | Users on waitlist           | 3500+ |

### Stealth Startup
Worked on a couple of ideas afterwards, including -
- **Quido**: OneStop center for afterschool activities for children
- **ProspectoAI**: SaaS tool to automate and enhance *OutBound based sales* and *lead-gen*
